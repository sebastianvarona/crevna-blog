One of the first questions we ask ourselves as developers when we get into the world of programming is **"Which language should I learn first?"**. Answering this question may seem like a simple task, however, with so many different options to choose from, it can be a bit complicated to find which choice best suits your own needs.

This article is aimed at beginners who want to start with a good option that **"ensures"** them a good employability and also at those developers who want to know if the languages ​​they handle are on the list of the programming languages ​​with most demand globally.

## 1. JavaScript

First on the list is **JavaScript**, surprised? JavaScript is one of the languages ​​with the most presence worldwide. Do you need to develop a static or dynamic website? JavaScript is a good option. Or maybe mobile or desktop apps? You can achieve it with JavaScript. It is this flexibility in ***Full Stack*** development and many more things for which this language is at the top of the list, since it is a relatively **"easy"** language to learn and has a lot of flexibility to develop many types of applications. This is why having this language in your portfolio can be very beneficial.

## 2. Python

Second on this list is **Python**. This should not come as a surprise to anyone either, since it is a language that is becoming more and more popular among developers due to its ease of learning given its similarity to the language. With this *object-oriented* language you can develop all kinds of applications with fewer lines of code than with other languages. Also, if you are interested in the branches of ***Artificial Intelligence***, ***Machine Learning*** and ***Data Science***, Python is your best option.

## 3. Java

For this third place we have **Java**. This powerful *object-oriented* language is similar to **C++**, and one of its advantages is that it can run on **any platform**. This means that you do not need to install it locally on your computer to run programs developed in this language. Some of the fields where developers who work with Java work are in web development, **mobile app development** and **desktop application development**.

## 4. TypeScript

This language is basically the child of *JavaScript*, since it is built from it. One of the things that sets them apart is that **TypeScript** catches most **errors during development**, and not like its predecessor *JavaScript* which jumps errors at run time. This small difference will help us develop applications with fewer errors, saving us a lot of time. We can use *TypeScript* in any environment that runs *JavaScript* since it is based on the latter. In addition to being compatible with all *JavaScript* frameworks, it is an excellent option to learn this 2022.

## 5. C#

To close this list we find **C#**, this multi-paradigm language developed by *Microsoft* derives from the **C/C++** languages ​​but is as robust as the aforementioned **Java**. *C#* is used to develop many types of applications. However, if you prefer **software development on *Windows*** or **game development** you should put this language in your portfolio as it has a strong presence mainly in these two areas.

## Conclusiones
As we could see, this 2022 is coming strong with great languages ​​leading the world labor market. Each language has its own *advantages* and *disadvantages* compared to other languages, so knowing the main characteristics and areas in which they can perform, you can choose any of these in this list and rest assured that **no you will regret it** in the future as they are all great options with huge popularity and reach.
