## What is java

Java is an **Object-Oriented-Programming language** that it's capable of producing software for multiple platforms. Every software written in this language it is compiled and **runs on most operating systems**.

## Advantages of Java

Java is widely used as a backend programming language and the advantages of using Java in the backend of your next software are a lot.

## Platform Independence

Java is known and loved for its **_“Write Once, Run Anywhere”_** approach, this means that all the code written in **Java can be run on any platform**, regardless of where it was originally created. This platform independence is possible thanks to the _Java Virtual Machine (**JVM**)_ – the environment where Java code is executed.

Before JVM, all software was written for a particular operating system, and JVM became a breakthrough by allowing the software to be run on any hardware or operating system where the JVM is installed. The JVM makes the Java source code readable by any platform without any special compilers.

## Libraries

For over **two decades**, Java has accumulated a great wealth of libraries containing reusable code components. Libraries are a great time-saving tool that encompass the knowledge of the vast Java community.

Most Java libraries are _open-source_ and _supported_ and _updated_ by experienced Java developers. The collection of Java libraries covers all programming aspects – there are general purpose libraries, such as Apache Commons, XML parsing libraries, such as JAXB, unit testing libraries, such as JUnit, and thousands more.

## Multi-threaded Processing

Java uses a multi-threaded web server that processes each request in a separate thread. Multi-threading allows for the performing of several tasks simultaneously without queueing the events.

Multi-threaded processing makes Java a great tool for CPU-intensive applications, such as video streaming, image editing, etc. With Java, multi-threading is integrated, while other languages need additional procedures for each operating system to enable multi-threaded request processing.
