Deploying your next app can be a complicated experience if you don't know what you are doing. One of the best options for developers to deploy their apps to the internet is VPS (**Virtual Private Servers**) Hosting. Due to the liberty, we can have during the launching process. If you have some technical skills with server administration VPS hosting is your best suit. Or even if you are just a beginner starting, there are tons of tutorials on how to configure your server correctly.  

The main difference between **"Shared Hosting"** and **VPS** hosting is that the first one you don't control almost nothing about your server. All of this is the responsibility of your hosting provider, it's like living in a rented house. The advantage of this type of hosting is that you don't need any technical knowledge and that it's really cheap. On the other hand, VPS hosting is basically renting a portion of a computer, it can be as fast as you need but you must configure the server from scratch. Both options can be good depending on what are your needs.
