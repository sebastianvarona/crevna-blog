In the computing world, when creating an application and managing its data, some of the main operations you can perform on this data are:

- Creation (**C**reate).
- Read (**R**ead).
- Update (**U**pdate).
- Elimination (**D**elete).

Forming the acronym in English **CRUD** that comes from these 4 operations with the **data records**. These operations serve both for database management and for the daily use of your application.
Remember that you can use any programming *language* or backend *framework* to perform a CRUD. You only need to make the necessary connections to a database, it does not matter if it is relational (**SQL**) or non-relational (**NoSQL**), if you want to know more about SQL and NoSQL databases you can consult [this article](https://www.crevna.com/sql-vs-nosql-which-one-to-choose).
